#  Python for Data Science

## Module 1: Introduction to Data Science and Data Exploration/Visualization

### 1.1: Python for Data Science Basics

#### Greetings, Young Data Explorers!

You're about to journey into the enchanting world of Data Science using Python! Just as an alchemist turns lead into gold, we'll learn how to turn raw data into insightful conclusions. So, buckle up for an adventure through Python's treasure trove of tools and tricks that make data dance and tell stories!

#### üîç Objective: Review and solidify basic Python concepts relevant to data science.

By the end of this session, we aim to strengthen our Python basics but with a twist ‚Äì we are going to look at them through the lens of data science. This isn't just magical theory; it's practical wizardry that you'll use to reveal hidden patterns and unlock the secrets buried within data.

### üêç Coding Example: Revisit Python Basics with a Focus on Data Science Applications.

Let's begin by conjuring up a Python list of numbers representing the heights of a grove of magical saplings. We'll perform some basic calculations to understand these heights better.

```python
# Our list of magical sapling heights in centimeters
sapling_heights = [120, 115, 150, 125, 130]

# We calculate the average height, which is the sum of all heights divided by the number of saplings.
average_height = sum(sapling_heights) / len(sapling_heights)
print(f"Average Sapling Height: {average_height}cm")

# Using a spell of comprehension, we also find which saplings are taller than average.
taller_than_average = [height for height in sapling_heights if height > average_height]
print(f"Saplings taller than average: {taller_than_average}")
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Average Sapling Height: 128.0cm
Saplings taller than average: [150, 130]
```

In the example above, we've revisited Python lists and list comprehensions, alongside doing vital calculations that are stepping stones to data analysis, such as averages.

### üåü Guided Project: Analyze a Small Dataset to Apply Python for Data Manipulation and Basic Analysis.

Now, let's analyze the inventory levels of a potion store! The shopkeeper has kept a record of the number of potion bottles in stock each day for one week. We will help figure out the average stock and which days had above-average inventory levels.

```python
# The inventory count of potion bottles each day over one week.
potion_inventory = [200, 220, 185, 198, 210, 215, 188]

# Computing the average inventory for the week.
average_inventory = sum(potion_inventory) / len(potion_inventory)
print(f"Average weekly inventory: {average_inventory} bottles")

# Identifying days with above-average inventory.
days_above_average = [index + 1 for index, count in enumerate(potion_inventory) if count > average_inventory]
print(f"Days with above-average inventory: {days_above_average}")
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Average weekly inventory: 202.85714285714286 bottles
Days with above-average inventory: [2, 5, 6]
```

Through the guided project, you applied Python's fundamental concepts like loops, list comprehensions, and arithmetic operations to solve a real-world scenario similar to data analysis problems.

#### üåê Superpowers: Reinforced Python Fundamentals for Data Science.

You have practiced the art of Pythonic analysis, which will be your reliable companion as you delve deeper into the realms of data science.

### 1.2: Exploring with Python Libraries

#### üìö Objective: Learn to use Python libraries for effective data exploration and visualization.

Python is filled with powerful spellbooks (libraries) like `Pandas` and `Matplotlib`, which help us explore, clean, and visualize data. Mastering these tools will empower you to translate numbers into stories and reveal insights that might otherwise remain unseen.

### üìä Coding Example: Introduction to Pandas and Matplotlib for Basic Data Exploration.

Before we start, make sure you have the `Pandas` and `Matplotlib` libraries. Open your command scroll (terminal) and recite the following incantation:

```sh
pip install pandas matplotlib
```

Now, conjure the spell to bring these libraries into your environment:

```python
# Calling upon Pandas and Matplotlib libraries.
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Let us create a small data scroll (DataFrame) with Pandas.
data = {
    "Elements": ["Fire", "Water", "Earth", "Air"],
    "Number of Wizards": [42, 65, 50, 10],
}
wizard_elements = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Display the data to see what it looks like.
print(wizard_elements)

# Now, let's visualize this data using Matplotlib.
plt.bar(wizard_elements["Elements"], wizard_elements["Number of Wizards"])
plt.title("Number of Wizards by Element")
plt.xlabel("Element")
plt.ylabel("Number of Wizards")
plt.show()
```

**Expected Table:**

```
  Elements  Number of Wizards
0     Fire                 42
1    Water                 65
2    Earth                 50
3      Air                 10
```

**Expected Plot:**
A bar chart will appear, showing the number of wizards corresponding to each element, with 'Element' on the x-axis and 'Number of Wizards' on the y-axis.

### üìà Guided Project: Visualize Trends and Patterns in a Real-world Dataset using Python.

We now embark on a quest to visualize the number of spells cast each day over a month. The local Wizard's Council collects this data to monitor magical activity.

```python
# We summon our magical libraries once again.
import random
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Here's the data from the Wizard's Council.
spell_data = {
    "Day": range(1, 31),  # Representing each day in the month.
    "Spells Cast": random.sample(range(200, 1000), 30),  # Imagine we have spell counts for all 30 days here.
}
spells_cast_df = pd.DataFrame(spell_data)

# Display our scroll with the dataframe.
print(spells_cast_df)

# Weaving our visualization spell with Matplotlib.
plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
plt.plot(spells_cast_df["Day"], spells_cast_df["Spells Cast"], marker='o')
plt.title("Spells Cast Over a Month")
plt.xlabel("Day of the Month")
plt.ylabel("Number of Spells Cast")
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

**Expected Table:**

A table showing 'Day' and corresponding 'Spells Cast' for all days of the month.

**Expected Plot:**
A beautiful line chart mapping the trend in spell casting activities over a month, with days on the x-axis and spells cast on the y-axis.

#### üßô Superpowers: Proficiency in Python Libraries for Data Exploration.

And there you have it, young sages! You've not only rekindled your foundational Python knowledge but have also awakened the magics of `Pandas` and `Matplotlib`! With these extraordinary abilities, you may see beyond the veil of raw data into a richer world of understanding and insight.

## Module 2: Statistical Analysis with Python with Machine Learning

### 2.1: Statistical Concepts in Python

#### Ahoj, Budding Data Scientists!

On today's thrilling trek through Python's jungles, we'll tangle with the vines of Statistics - the ancient, number-crunching magic that roots our machine learning saplings firmly in the ground. So, lace up your data boots, We're diving into the world of statistics, ready for an exciting exploration!

#### üî¢ Objective: Apply Statistical Analysis Techniques Using Python

Statistical analysis is like having a spyglass that can peek through the foggy mists of numbers and data points. We use this spyglass to find patterns, make predictions, and tell tales of what the numbers whisper to us. With Python, our trusty sidekick, we'll perform feats of statistical wonder!

### üßÆ Coding Example: Utilize NumPy for Basic Statistical Calculations in Python

First things first: we need our stats toolkit. NumPy is a chest filled with numerical tools that'll help us calculate faster than a rogue wizard's getaway broomstick.

Open your command scroll (terminal) and utter the spell:

```sh
pip install numpy
```

Now, let's get our hands on some number-crunching action.

```python
# We summon the NumPy library to aid us in our statistical journey.
import numpy as np

# Here we have an array of dragon's weights, in kilograms!
dragon_weights = np.array([250, 300, 280, 340, 330, 260, 270])

# Let‚Äôs calculate the average weight - the arithmetic middle of our data points.
average_weight = np.mean(dragon_weights)
print(f"Average Dragon Weight: {average_weight}kg")

# We calculate the median weight, the one in the middle when all are sorted.
median_weight = np.median(dragon_weights)
print(f"Median Dragon Weight: {median_weight}kg")

# Now, let's find the variance, that tells us how spread out the weights are.
variance = np.var(dragon_weights)
print(f"Variance: {variance}")

# Finally, the standard deviation is the square root of variance.
std_deviation = np.sqrt(variance)
print(f"Standard Deviation: {std_deviation}kg")
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Average Dragon Weight: 290.0kg
Median Dragon Weight: 280.0kg
Variance: 860.0
Standard Deviation: 29.325756...kg
```

In this enchanting example, we combed through a dragon dataset using NumPy to find mean, median, variance, and standard deviation, which are the foundational incantations of statistical wisdom.

### üìè Guided Project: Conduct a Statistical Study on a Given Dataset Using Python

Now it's time to lead an expedition into a dataset of the annual rainfall in the enchanted forest. Each value represents how much rain fell each year for the past century. Let's unravel the mysteries behind these showers.

```python
# We call upon NumPy once again!
import numpy as np

# Our century's worth of rainfall data, measured in millimeters.
rainfall_data = np.array(np.array([1,30])  # Let's imagine this array is full of 100 numbers.

# Calculate some statistical measures.
mean_rainfall = np.mean(rainfall_data)
print(f"Average Yearly Rainfall: {mean_rainfall}mm")

median_rainfall = np.median(rainfall_data)
print(f"Median Yearly Rainfall: {median_rainfall}mm")

# Let's roll up our sleeves for something trickier: the Interquartile Range!
# First, we find the lower and upper quartiles.
q1 = np.percentile(rainfall_data, 25)
q3 = np.percentile(rainfall_data, 75)

# The interquartile range (IQR) is the difference between Q3 and Q1.
iqr = q3 - q1
print(f"Interquartile Range: {iqr}mm")
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Average Yearly Rainfall: 15.5 mm
Median Yearly Rainfall: 15.5 mm
Interquartile Range: 14.5 mm
```

Analysis complete! By calculating the mean, median, and IQR (a measure of how far apart the middle data points are), you've gently coaxed some fiercely-guarded secrets of the rainfall data out into the daylight.

#### üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Superpowers: Statistical Analysis Skills with Python

Consider yourself endowed with statistical superpowers! You've wielded NumPy spells to command the numbers to speak truth. Use these new skills wisely, as they are crucial in the grand quest of machine learning.

### 2.2: Intro to Machine Learning with Python

#### ü§ñ Objective: Explore the Basics of Machine Learning Using Python

Machine Learning is like capturing the essence of a spell in a crystal ball, allowing it to learn and predict all on its own! It's not sorcery; it's science! And Python is our enchanted staff that casts spells (algorithms) to teach our crystal balls (models) how to foresee (predict) what‚Äôs to come.

### üéì Coding Example: Introduction to scikit-learn for Machine Learning in Python

Before we cast our first machine-learning spell, we need to gather our magical ingredients, the scikit-learn library.

Call forth the library with the chant:

```sh
pip install scikit-learn
```

Let us cast our first incantation to predict whether a fruit is a lemon or an apple based on its weight and color score:

```python
# Summon the scikit-learn library!
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

# Envision a table where each row contains the fruit's weight and color score.
# Fruit: Lemon(0), Apple(1), Weight (grams), Color Score (0-1, yellow-red)
fruit_data = [[150, 0.3], [170, 0.7], [140, 0.4], [130, 0.2], [200, 0.5]]
fruit_labels = [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]  # The known identity of each fruit.

# We are creating a crystal ball, a machine learning model!
fruit_predictor = DecisionTreeClassifier()
# We teach the crystal ball with data using a spell called 'fit'.
fruit_predictor.fit(fruit_data, fruit_labels)

# Let's predict the fruit based on a new set of data.
mystery_fruit = [[160, 0.3]]  # Let's imagine this represents a new fruit.
prediction = fruit_predictor.predict(mystery_fruit)
fruit = "Lemon" if prediction == 0 else "Apple"
print(f"The mystery fruit is likely a: {fruit}")
```

**Expected Output:**
```
The mystery fruit is likely a: Lemon
```

In this coding potion, we‚Äôve entrusted a Decision Tree (a simple model) with the wisdom of our data. It now has the foresight to tell us whether a fruit is a lemon or an apple.

### üå± Guided Project: Implement a Simple Machine Learning Model Using Python

The time has come to bring our young machine learning seedling to full bloom. We shall predict if a student passes or fails based on the hours they've studied and their level of sleepiness.

```python
# We once again summon the scikit-learn library and its allies.
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

# Students' study data: Hours Studied, Sleepiness Scale (1-10, 10 being very sleepy).
student_data = [[10, 2], [4, 5], [6, 3], [3, 6], [8, 1]]
student_results = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]  # Pass (1) or Fail (0).

# Split the data into a training set and a test set.
(train_data, test_data, train_results, test_results) = train_test_split(
    student_data, student_results, test_size=0.2
)

# The seedling grows; we craft our decision tree model.
student_predictor = DecisionTreeClassifier()
student_predictor.fit(train_data, train_results)

# Time to test our seedling's growth. We make a prediction on the test set.
predictions = student_predictor.predict(test_data)

# Let's see how we did by comparing predicted results to actual results.
print(f"Predicted: {predictions}")
print(f"Actual: {test_results}")
```

**Expected Output:**
Something along the lines of:
```
Predicted: [1]
Actual: [1]
```

Pat yourself on the back! Our tree of knowledge blossomed beautifully, showcasing predictive power that once seemed locked within the realm of fortune-tellers.

#### üåü Superpowers: Proficiency in Basic Machine Learning with Python

You've unlocked the superpower of machine learning with Python, harnessed the strength of scikit-learn, and unleashed your very first prediction model. You're on your way to becoming a Python Machine Learning Magician! May your insights be as deep and as wide as the Great Python Sea.

## Module 3: Predictive Analytics with Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

### 3.1: Advanced Machine Learning Techniques

#### üöÄ Objective: Dive into Advanced Machine Learning Techniques for Predictive Analytics

Welcome back, data adventurers! It's time to sharpen your wits and delve deeper into the labyrinth of machine learning. We're going past the beginner spells and stepping into a realm where techniques become more complex yet significantly more potent. Here, we craft predictive analytics like master jewelers polish diamonds.

### ü§ñ Coding Example: Implement Advanced Machine Learning Algorithms in Python

Have you ever heard of a fantastical contraption called the "Random Forest"? It‚Äôs not a woodland made of randomness, but an ensemble of decision trees! Let‚Äôs bring forth this spell using the enchanted `scikit-learn`.

Firstly, ensure you're equipped with the `scikit-learn` library:

```sh
pip install scikit-learn
```

```python
# We call forth our trusted scikit-learn and its enchantment, Random Forest.
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Imagine we have a dataset of creatures and their features. 
# Just as a spell could determine if a creature is magical or mundane, 
# so too can our Random Forest Classifier.
creature_features = [[2, 1], [4, 3], [1, 2], [5, 5], [2, 4]]
creature_labels = [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]  # Magical (1) or Mundane (0).

# Prepare our magical forest of decision trees!
magic_forest = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=10)

# We teach our forest with the ancient creatures' data.
magic_forest.fit(creature_features, creature_labels)

# A mysterious creature appears! Let's predict its nature.
mystery_creature = [[3, 3]]
prediction = magic_forest.predict(mystery_creature)
nature = "Magical" if prediction == 1 else "Mundane"
print(f"The Mystery Creature is: {nature}")
```

**Expected Output:**
```
The Mystery Creature is: Mundane
```

This sophisticated charm summons a council of decision trees which together, make a much wiser guess about our creatures. More heads, better decisions!

### üåê Guided Project: Apply Predictive Analytics on a Complex Dataset Using Python

Now let‚Äôs embark on a quest to uncover the future trends of a mystical bazaar. We've obtained a dataset with years of sales data. Our mission: to predict future sales based on it.

```python
# We must gather our tools: Pandas for data reading, and Random Forest for predictions.
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error


# Read the mystical bazaar data using Pandas.
bazaar_data = pd.read_csv('mystical_bazaar_sales.csv')

# Prepare our features (X) and target (y). Let's assume 'next_month_sales' is what we want to predict.
X = bazaar_data.drop('Sales', axis=1)
y = bazaar_data['Sales']

# We split our ancient data into training and testing concoctions.
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# We create our Random Forest, but this time for regression instead of classification.
bazaar_forest = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=10)
bazaar_forest.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set and compare with actual values to find our forest's accuracy.
predicted_sales = bazaar_forest.predict(X_test)
# Here we use a magical potion to measure our error in prediction -- but you'll learn that in a different quest!
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predicted_sales)
accuracy = 100 * (1 - mse / max(y_test.max(), (y_test.max() - y_test.min())**2))

print(f"Prediction Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

In this ambitious spell, the Random Forest algorithm has tried its best to prognosticate the unseen. With the actual and predicted sales, we could gauge how well our forest has divined.

#### üåü Superpowers: Mastery in Advanced Machine Learning Techniques

Congratulations! You've not only touched but seized the helm of advanced machine learning techniques. Like master wizards, you‚Äôll wield these spells to foresee, predict, and enlighten.

### 3.2: Strategies for Data Cleaning

#### üßπ Objective: Learn Techniques for Handling Missing Data and Outliers in Python

Before one can embark on the noble quest of prediction, one must traverse the murky marshes of dirty data. Fear not! Cleaning data is simply preparing our raw materials so they're in the best shape to be transformed into insights. Today, we tackle missing data and oddball numbers, also known as 'outliers'.

### üßΩ Coding Example: Implement Strategies for Cleaning and Preprocessing Data Using Python

For this mission, you'll need the `Pandas` package, which you can summon with the following incantation:

```sh
pip install pandas
```

Equipped with `Pandas` , let's shine up some messy data to make it sparkle!!

```python
# We call Pandas to our aid.
import pandas as pd

# Let us imagine a dataset with some missing values.
messy_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Potion Strength': [10, 15, None, 12, None],
    'Ingredients': [5, 7, 8, None, 7]
})

# Fill in missing numbers with the average of their column.
clean_data = messy_data.fillna(messy_data.mean())
print(clean_data)

# Now, let's say 50 is an impossible number of ingredients, an outlier!
# We apply an ancient technique to limit our data to plausible values.
clean_data['Ingredients'] = clean_data['Ingredients'].clip(upper=10)
print(clean_data)
```

**Expected Output:**
```
   Potion Strength  Ingredients
0             10.0          5.0
1             15.0          7.0
2             12.5          8.0
3             12.0          6.75
4             12.5          7.0

   Potion Strength  Ingredients
0             10.0          5.0
1             15.0          7.0
2             12.5          8.0
3             12.0          6.75
4             12.5          7.0
```

In this example, we filled missing values with averages and tamed outliers with the `clip` spell from our `Pandas` spellbook.

### üìñ Guided Project: Clean and Prepare a Messy Dataset for Analysis in Python

Now, let us apply our cleaning spells to a real-world dataset, a tome rumored to predict the flight patterns of migrating dragons.

```python
# Begin with Pandas by your side.
import pandas as pd
# Read the tome, err... dataset.
dragon_data = pd.read_csv('dragon_data.csv')

# Time to clean. We shall drop all rows where there are missing values.
clean_data = dragon_data.dropna()

# We must also ensure our data does not contain duplicate entries.
clean_data = clean_data.drop_duplicates()

# Detect and handle outliers. Here we use the Z-Score, a measure of how many standard deviations
# an element is from the mean. Don‚Äôt worry; we shall not be delving into z-scores just yet!
# For now, know that any data point with a z-score greater than 3 or less than -3 is an outlier.
from scipy import stats
z_scores = stats.zscore(clean_data)
clean_data = clean_data[(abs(z_scores) < 3).all(axis=1)]

# At long last, the dataset is clean!
clean_data.to_csv('clean_dragon_migration.csv', index=False)
print("The Dragon Migration Data is Cleansed and Ready!")
```

With meticulous effort and powerful `Pandas` and `scipy` incantations, we‚Äôve turned a chaotic manuscript into a polished spellbook of knowledge.

#### üé© Superpowers: Expertise in Data Cleaning and Preprocessing with Python

Well done! You've braved the tangled forests of messy data and emerged victorious. Having garnered the prowess of a data cleansing maestro, you now possess the expertise to transform even the murkiest of datasets into gleaming sources of wisdom. With clean data, your machine learning spells will be twice as potent!

Brew your potions with care, wield your data-science sword with precision, and may your models be ever accurate!

## Module 4: Feature Engineering Techniques with Data Storytelling

### 4.1: Advanced Feature Engineering Techniques

#### üé© Objective: Explore Advanced Feature Engineering Techniques in Python

Howdy, intrepid data crafters! Feature engineering is the art of transforming raw data into attributes that our predictive models can digest‚Äîit's like turning rough gemstones into twinkling jewels fit for a royal crown. Let's level up your feature-crafting talents with some advanced Python techniques!

### üî® Coding Example: Implement Advanced Feature Engineering Methods in Python

In the world of feature engineering, sometimes we must create new features from existing ones or transform them entirely to reveal their true predictive power. Let's demonstrate this with a fascinating dataset of magical creatures.

First, ensure you have the powerful tools `NumPy` and `Pandas` at your disposal:

```sh
pip install numpy pandas
```

Now, with our toolkit ready, let's step into our magic workshop.

```python
# Summoning our loyal assistants, NumPy and Pandas
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Behold! The raw data of our peculiar creatures‚Äô characteristics
creature_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Wing Size': [35, 48, 52, 22, 40],
    'Tail Length': [15, 25, 35, 5, 20],
    'Magic Power': [80, 120, 150, 60, 100],
    'Type': ['Dragon', 'Gryphon', 'Dragon', 'Sprite', 'Dragon']
})

# Let's do some spellcraft - we shall create a "Power-to-Wing Size Ratio"
creature_data['Power-to-Wing Ratio'] = creature_data['Magic Power'] / creature_data['Wing Size']

# Perhaps creatures of the same type have similar traits? Let's encode 'Type'!
creature_data = pd.get_dummies(creature_data, columns=['Type'])

print(creature_data)
```

**Expected Output:**

```plaintext
   Wing Size  Tail Length  Magic Power  Power-to-Wing Ratio  Type_Dragon  Type_Gryphon  Type_Sprite
0         35           15           80              2.285714            1             0            0
1         48           25          120              2.500000            0             1            0
2         52           35          150              2.884615            1             0            0
3         22            5           60              2.727273            0             0            1
4         40           20          100              2.500000            1             0            0
```

In this example, we've derived a new feature and encoded categorical data‚Äîone changes the shape of the gem; the other alters its color. Both are prepared to shine in our model.
`pd.get_dummies` convert categorical variable into dummy/indicator variables. Each variable is converted in as many 0/1 variables as there are different values. Columns in the output are each named after a value; if the input is a DataFrame, the name of the original variable is prepended to the value.

### üîÆ Guided Project: Enhance a Model with Advanced Feature Engineering in Python

Imagine you're a wizard whose mission is to predict the growth of magical plants. You have data on soil quality, sunlight, and the amount of enchanted water they receive. We will perform advanced feature engineering to make our predictions more accurate.

```python
# We continue with the help of NumPy and Pandas.
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# First, we read our dataset of magical plant growth.
plants_data = pd.read_csv('magical_plants_growth.csv')

# We engineer a feature: "Enchanted Water to Sunlight Ratio"
plants_data['Enchanted-to-Sunlight Ratio'] = plants_data['Enchanted Water'] / plants_data['Sunlight']

# Split our dataset into features (X) and target (y)
X = plants_data.drop(['Growth'], axis=1)
y = plants_data['Growth']

# Train our Random Forest model with enhanced features.
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.25, random_state=42)
model = RandomForestRegressor()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Assess how well our feature engineering has paid off!
score = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Our magical plant predictor's score is: {score}")
```

Through the guided project, you have become adept at creating new features and honed the clarity of your models, much like polishing a lens to perfection.

#### üß† Superpowers: Skill in Crafting Powerful and Relevant Features

Behold your newly refined talent for sculpting raw data into gleaming features that possess the power to unlock untold stories within your models!

### 4.2: Creating Narratives with Python

#### üìñ Objective: Learn to Tell a Compelling Data-Driven Story Using Python

Enchanting storyteller, the time has come to weave data into tales that captivate and illuminate. By marrying numbers with narrative, we transform stats into stories, and insights into actions. Let's harness Python to craft these narrative arcs.

### üé® Coding Example: Use Seaborn for Data Storytelling in Python

To create our visual tales, we summon Seaborn‚Äîa mystical library that brings beauty and clarity to our graphs. If you haven't yet acquainted yourself with Seaborn, beckon it with this spell:

```sh
pip install seaborn
```

Let's demonstrate how we might illustrate the life cycle of magical creatures through baroque visuals.

```python
# Invoking Seaborn, along with our old friends Matplotlib and Pandas
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Our mystical creature lifespan data
lifespan_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Creature': ['Dragon', 'Gryphon', 'Sprite', 'Phoenix'],
    'Average Lifespan': [450, 150, 20, 1000]
})

# For our narrative, we shall craft a longevity bar chart.
sns.barplot(x='Creature', y='Average Lifespan', data=lifespan_data)
plt.title('The Longevity of Mystical Creatures')
plt.xlabel('Magical Creature')
plt.ylabel('Average Lifespan in Years')
plt.show()
```

**Expected Plot:**

A bar chart will display, depicting each mystical creature along the x-axis and their average lifespans on the y-axis, with the title and axes clearly labeled.

### üìö Guided Project: Create a Narrative Backed by Data in Python

Now we shall embark on our grand quest: to narrate the economic impacts of dragon-keeping over the last century. We have a dataset filled with numbers, but we'll turn it into a story of prosperity, decline, and revival.

```python
# Our tale begins with Pandas and Seaborn at our side.
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Reading our ancient dragon economy data.
dragon_economy = pd.read_csv('dragon_economy.csv')

# To tell our story, we will visualize the data.
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.lineplot(x='Year', y='Dragon-Related Profits', data=dragon_economy)
sns.lineplot(x='Year', y='Dragon-Related Losses', data=dragon_economy)
plt.title('Economic Impacts of Dragon-Keeping Through the Ages')
plt.legend(['Profits', 'Losses'])
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Gold Coins (in millions)')
plt.show()
```

Through this guided project, you've taken the bones of cold data and breathed life into them, conjuring forth a visual epic that guides viewers through a chronological journey, much like a bard enlightens a rapt audience with enchanted tales.

#### üé≠ Superpowers: Ability to Communicate Findings Through Data-Driven Narratives

Equipped with Seaborn and your analytical prowess, you can now narrate the stories hidden within data. From telling numeric tales to revealing the plots of points and lines, you have gained the superpower of data-driven storytelling. Craft your narratives well, and may your insights find eager audiences far and wide!

## Module 5: Deep Learning and Final Project - Capstone

### 5.1: Introduction to Deep Learning with Python

#### üß† Objective: Explore Deep Learning Fundamentals Using Python

Hey there, digital detectives! We're about to enter the dojo of Deep Learning‚Äîone of the most powerful chambers in the castle of data science. In this dojo, neural networks learn to solve riddles that other algorithms find too puzzling. Imagine training a dragon to do math‚Äîthat's the kind of cool stuff we're talking about!

### ü§ñ Coding Example: Basics of Deep Learning with TensorFlow in Python

To begin our deep learning adventure, we need a loyal companion‚ÄîTensorFlow. This tool is like a magical tome for writing spells of deep learning. Don‚Äôt worry if it sounds complex. Just follow along, and soon you'll be crafting neural network spells of your own!

### üìö Important Ingredients of Deep Learning

#### Activations Functions
Artificial neural networks rely heavily on activation functions, which are mathematical operations applied to the output of each neuron in a neural network layer. The network may learn intricate patterns and relationships in the data thanks to the non-linearities these functions introduce.

The following are some typical activation functions:

1. **Step Function:** - Binary activation; output is 0 otherwise and 1 when the input is above a predetermined threshold.

2. **The Sigmoid Function**
   - Equation: sigma(x) = frac(1)/(1 + e^(-x))
   Range of output: 0 to 1
   Squashes the output to a probability-like range, making it a popular choice for binary classification models' output layer.

3. The **Hyperbolic Tangent (tanh):** - Equation:tanh(x)= (e^(x) - e^(-x))/(e^(-x)) + e^(x))
   -1, 1 is the output range.
   - Has a wider output range and is comparable to the sigmoid. utilised in concealed situations frequently.

These are just a few examples; there are more activation functions available, each suited to different use cases.

#### Optimizers
An optimizer in the context of deep learning refers to an algorithm or a method that adjusts the internal parameters of a neural network during the training process. The primary goal of an optimizer is to minimize the error or loss function by iteratively updating the model's weights.
There are various optimizers, each with its own update rules and strategies. Common optimizers include:

1. **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):** The simplest optimizer, which updates weights in the opposite direction of the gradient with a fixed learning rate.

2. 	**Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation):** An adaptive learning rate optimizer that combines the advantages of two other methods‚ÄîAdaGrad and RMSProp. It adjusts the learning rates individually

#### Loss Functions
Loss, in the context of deep learning, refers to a measure of the difference between the predicted output of a neural network and the actual target values (ground truth). It quantifies how well or poorly the model is performing on a specific task. The objective during the training phase is to minimize this loss, thereby improving the accuracy of the model's predictions.

1. **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Commonly used for regression tasks, it measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.

2. **Cross-Entropy Loss (or Log Loss):** Typical for classification problems, it measures the dissimilarity between the predicted probabilities and the true class distribution.

3. **Hinge Loss:** Used in support vector machines and certain types of classifiers, especially in binary classification tasks.

We've completed the fundamental lessons in deep learning. Now, let's leap into our main track.

Let‚Äôs first summon TensorFlow with the sacred pip chant:

```sh
pip install tensorflow
```

Here‚Äôs a simple example to create a neural network that can tell the difference between apples and bananas:

```python
# Importing TensorFlow, the wise sage of deep learning
import tensorflow as tf

# Let's use a tiny bit of enchantment to create our first neural network layer.
layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=2, activation='relu', input_shape=[2])

# Time to assemble our neural network model.
model = tf.keras.Sequential([layer])

# We must compile our model, choosing spells (optimizer) and potions (loss)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy')

# Time to teach our model with "data" (just pretend we have some!)
train_data = [[0.2, 0.9], [0.1, 0.4]]  # A feature set with dummy data.
train_labels = [1, 0]  # 1 for banana, 0 for apple.

# Educate the model about the ways of apples and bananas.
model.fit(train_data, train_labels, epochs=5)

# Our model has learned! Now let's ask it to identify a mystery fruit.
mystery_fruit = [[0.2, 0.8]]  # New fruit data for prediction.
prediction = model.predict(mystery_fruit)

# Which is it, apple or banana?
print("This mystery fruit is a:", "Banana" if prediction[0][1] > prediction[0][0] else "Apple")
```

**Expected Output:**
```
This mystery fruit is a: Banana
```

What did we just do? We constructed a neural network and trained it to recognize fruit, like teaching a puppy to sit‚Äîexcept this puppy will eventually predict stock markets or drive your car!

### üåê Guided Project: Apply Deep Learning to Solve a Real-World Problem in Python

Now it's time for you to apply what you've learned in a real-world scenario! Imagine dragons actually exist, and we want to use deep learning to analyze dragon sightings‚Äîclassifying them by species based on their features.

```python
# We continue with TensorFlow as our guide.
import tensorflow as tf

# Suppose we have a dataset of dragon sightings. Each sighting details the dragon's scale color and roar pitch.
dragon_sightings = [[30, 550], [22, 475], ...]  # More data...
species_labels = [0, 1, ...]  # 0 for Fire Dragon, 1 for Ice Dragon, etc.

# First, we normalize our data; this is like adjusting a telescope for a clearer view.
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaled_sightings = scaler.fit_transform(dragon_sightings)

# With our vision clear, we now create a network deeper than the last, with more layers.
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu', input_shape=[2]),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(3, activation='softmax')
])

# Our spells chosen, we compile our model. This time, we anticipate three species of dragons.
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy')

# Let's train our model on the dragon data.
model.fit(scaled_sightings, species_labels, epochs=10)
```

In this guided project, we've broadened our deep learning toolkit by scaling our data and building a deeper model to categorize dragons! How awesome is that?

# Read the data of past magic shows and their success rates.
magic_shows = pd.read_csv('magic_shows_data.csv')

# Perform some data cleansing rituals, preparing our dataset for the model.
magic_shows.fillna(magic_shows.mean(), inplace=True)
magic_shows.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)

# Engineer some new features that could help the model predict better.
magic_shows['Performer_Experience'] = magic_shows['Years_of_Experience'] / magic_shows['Age_of_Performer']

# Create our machine learning model.
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=[len(magic_shows.columns) - 1]),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compiling the model with optimizer and loss function
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Split data into training and testing sets
X = magic_shows.drop('Success', axis=1).values
y = magic_shows['Success'].values
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Train the model on our prepared data
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

# Assess the model's performance
performance = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Magic show prediction model accuracy: {performance[1]}")
```
